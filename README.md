# Obstacle Alert System (LPC2148 + Ultrasonic Sensor)

This project implements an **Obstacle Detection and Alert System** using the **LPC2148 microcontroller** and **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor**, simulated in **Proteus**.  
The system measures the distance of obstacles and provides **real-time alerts** using an LCD display, buzzer, and LEDs.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Real-time distance measurement using **ultrasonic sensor**.  
- **16x2 LCD Display** shows distance and alert status.  
- **LED Indicators** (3 levels) to show proximity.  
- **Buzzer Alert** when an obstacle is dangerously close.  
- Threshold-based distance analysis for safe, warning, and danger zones.
